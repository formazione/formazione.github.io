<h2>knowledge-based marketing</h2>
<p>
The alternative to this old approach is knowledge-based and experience-based marketing. Knowledge-based marketing requires a company to master a scale of knowledge: of the technology in which it competes; of its competition; of its customers; of new sources of technology that can alter its competitive environment; and of its own organization, capabilities, plans, and way of doing business. Armed with this mastery, companies can put knowledge-based marketing to work in three essential ways: integrating the customer into the design process to guarantee a product that is tailored not only to the customers’ needs and desires but also to the customers’ strategies; generating niche thinking to use the company’s knowledge of channels and markets to identify segments of the market the company can own; and developing the infrastructure of suppliers, vendors, partners, and users whose relationships will help sustain and support the company’s reputation and technological edge.

<h2>Experience-based marketing (Regis McKenna)</h2>

<p>
The other half of this new marketing paradigm is experience-based marketing, which emphasizes interactivity, connectivity, and creativity. With this approach, companies spend time with their customers, constantly monitor their competitors, and develop a feedback-analysis system that turns this information about the market and the competition into important new product intelligence. At the same time, these companies both evaluate their own technology to assess its currency and cooperate with other companies to create mutually advantageous systems and solutions. These close encounters—with customers, competitors, and internal and external technologies—give companies the firsthand experience they need to invest in market development and to take intelligent, calculated risks.

    <h2>Il marketing mix: le 4 P</h2>

    <p>Cos'è il marketing mix?</p>

    <p>Il marketing strategico è l'insieme di analisi e scelte che portano a definire gli obiettivi di lungo periodo. Il marketing operativo è, invece, l'insieme di scelte che porta a definire gli obiettivi di breve periodo, finalizzati a raggiungere quelli di lungo periodo. Si parla di piani, quando si traducono gli obiettivi e le strategie per raggiungerli, se riferiti al lungo periodo; si parla di programmi, al contrario, per riferirsi ai documenti che esplicitano gli obiettivi e le tattiche di breve periodo. Per raggiungere gli obiettivi del prossimo anno, si utilizzano le 4 leve o variabili, dette marketing mix.</p>

<p>
Si tratta delle variabili: prodotto, prezzo, place (distribuzione) e promotion (comunicazione). Ognuna è cruciale per informare (comunicazione), raggiungere (place/distribuzione) e offrire (product) il prodotto o servizio giusto al prezzo accettato dai consumatori e remunerativo per le imprese (price).</p>

    <p>She said that he loved baseball, and James Earl Jones; said that he's got god talking inside of his thoughts while he's
      rounding those bases on his way back home</p>

    <p>If you build it, they will come (and baby listens to what the Lord say). But I've been getting pretty worn, building
      for nearly a decade</p>

    <p>In a perfect world we shouldn’t have been allowed to lose sight of what it means to love wholly. I’ve got a Polaroid
      hanging on my wall that a friend took of me and my angel. I remember the day like it’s something I can touch, but it’s
      stuck in the square between the borders of the film, and I can run my fingers over our faces, but I can’t get back
      to the places we were</p>


    <blockquote>
      <p>You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"You’ve got a pain deep in your bones, son. It compels you forward like you’re tied to a slave master’s cruel hand, and
      it's the same pain that drives that oppressor’s heart of stone, so you’ve grown to love the man. You keep pouring yourself
      out, again and again, into legible lines through a crooked pen." Yeah, it’s painful, but it’s familiar – so habit breeds
      comfort, and I don’t know what I’d do without him</p>

    </div>

    <p>So in the early morning, when you’ve fallen asleep in our home, I drift back into the memories that I’ve claimed as my
      own, and wonder if tonight will be a night I’ll hang on my wall like I did before we stopped taking photos, out of
      the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all</p>

    <p>In a perfect world, we’ll have albums labeled Seasons, with chapter headings, and we’ll staple them to the cork-board
      that hangs at the foot of the bed. There’s longevity in a memory spilt out in pen, and if a picture is worth a thousand
      words then I’ve written down every one of them</p>

    <p>I work hard, scarred, toil through that soil for the youth I see in my friends, but these journals are moments in time,
      snapshots of our lives, and in retrospect, age is an overexposed photo that the memories can't mend</p>

    <p>I know my sweet seductress, and her name is Depression. I wrote best beneath that demon’s destructive oppression</p>


    <p>In those Polaroids, she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his master’s cruel hand, and I hated that
      whip but always wondered what I’d do without it, so I grew to love the man</p>

    <p>Oh, I wept for change! I begged for movement and the good Lord, he answered my prayers, but you don’t know how to breathe
      easy when you let go of your habits, even if your comforts left you gasping for air</p>

    <h2>Dear Time</h2>

    <p>Grandfather's as creaky as his front porch, scent like oil in the gun barrel, dip-can kicked over the railing, sandpaper
      hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall. I’ve got an ache in my chest for every season I miss and it gets worse when
      the snow starts to fall. There are butterflies alive in that couple’s eyes a few years since forgotten by all, and
      sometimes, if the phone starts to ring, I can still hear their wings when you call</p>

    <p>But I begged for movement and I got what I asked for, and I can picture the answer like it came yesterday. And in the
      land of the gods, I think that things are timeless, but we are still prone to decay</p>

    <p>You know I still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when I pray</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"Idle hands build nothing that you can call your own"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Time is a cruel lover, and she breaks her house apart at its bones. You know comfort is no good reason for standing still,
      and idle hands build nothing that you can call your own.</p>
